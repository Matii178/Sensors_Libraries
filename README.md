# Sensors_Libraries
In this repository I will focus on practising "object based programming" using C within embedded systems category.  
The aim of this repository is to create as many sensors' libraries as it is neccessary to build solid fundamentals of STM32 programming.

**Libraries done:**
* AM2320 *I2C*
* BMP280 *I2C*


**Currently focusing on:**
* ADXL345 *SPI*
